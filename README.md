# Sevak — A Reputation-Driven Platform for Daily Wage Workers

Sevak is a community-first platform that reimagines how daily wage workers connect with employers. It empowers workers through **reputation tokens**, builds trust via **performance-based reviews**, and creates an ecosystem of **economic mobility, dignity, and digital identity**.
